For the following examples, the variable $example should be set
to the location of this directory.  For a typical installation
	example=/sys/src/cmd/pq/example
Once installed, the default location for the dispatch file of
/lib/pq/dispatch will remove the need for the -m flag.

List addresses for all entries in the directory.  Note that the line with "%street2"
is only printed if it is not empty.
	pq -m 'join '^$example^'/dispatch' \
		-o '%first %last\n%street\<\n%<>street2\>\n%city, %state  %zip\n' ''

List phone numbers and type for all entries in the directory.
	pq -m 'join '^$example^'/dispatch' -o '%15last %15first %number (%type)' ''

List the "Home" phone number for anyone with the last name "Smith".
	pq -m 'join '^$example^'/dispatch' -o '%number' 'last=Smith|type=Home'

List all the "Home" and "Mobile" numbers in the directory.
	pq -m 'join '^$example^'/dispatch' \
		-o '%type number for %first %last is %number' 'type=Home|type=Mobile'

Create an alphabetized list of addresses and phone numbers for the
entire directory.  The first pq creates a list of "ssn"s that is in
alphabetical order.  The next pq prints the address and the final pq
prints the phone numbers.

Question for the reader: What would happen if we combined the address
and phone number queries into one query?  Try it and find out.

for (i in `{pq -m 'join '^$example^'/dispatch' \
		-o '%last %first %ssn'  '' | sort -df | sed 's/.* //'})
	{
	pq -m 'join '^$example^'/dispatch' \
		-o '%first %last\n%street\<\n%<>street2\>\n%city, %state  %zip' 'ssn='$i
	pq -m 'join '^$example^'/dispatch' -o '%6type: %number' 'ssn='$i
	echo ''
	}
