.SH NAME
dispatch \- PQ IRDB directory configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dispatch
files are used by the
.I join
module of
.IR pq (1)
to access an Implicit Relational Database (IRDB) directory.
A
.I dispatch
file contains a list of module arguments, one per line.
Argument words are separated by white space.
An open is attempted for each line in turn until one succeeds, or the
end of file is reached, in which case an error is returned.

See
.IR modules (7)
for a description of
.I join
and module arguments.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following dispatch file describes relations for two local
directories and a pointer to a host for attributes that can
not be found locally.  The two local relations are in the
directories
.B /lib/pq/name
and
.BR /lib/pq/phone .
Within those directories are
.L Data
and
.L Proto
files that contain the values for the relation and
the attributes for that relation, respectively.
